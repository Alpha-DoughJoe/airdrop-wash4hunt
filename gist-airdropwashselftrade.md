# Transaction Generator Gist

This gist contains a sample project for generating randomized cryptocurrency transactions between wallets.

The project is structured into the following files:

- `config.py` - Configuration settings 
- `utils.py` - Helper functions
- `send.py` - Logic for sending transactions
- `bridge.py` - Logic for bridging tokens  
- `app.py` - Main application

## Usage

To use:

1. Update `config.py` with wallet addresses, API keys, etc. 

2. Implement transaction/bridge logic in `send.py`/`bridge.py`.

3. Run `python app.py` to generate random transactions.

The `app.py` loop randomly selects wallets, amounts, delays between transfers.

## Configuration

`config.py` contains settings like:

- `WALLETS` - List of wallet addresses
- `TOKEN_ADDRESS` - Contract address of token
- `MIN/MAX_AMOUNT` - Transfer amount limits

## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:

- Monitoring and metrics
- Web UI for configuration
- Dynamic wallet/token selection
- Failure injection  
- Scheduled runs
